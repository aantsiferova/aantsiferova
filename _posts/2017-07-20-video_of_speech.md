title: First speech in english
---

Hi everyone!

On 18th July I was asked to tell about our research group's key scientific project, and I had to do this almost without preparing. 
This was my first experience of speaking in English, not counting the speech on the ["Falling Walls Lab"](https://cs.msu.ru/news/2280), because by the rules the speech was to last only three minutes and I had a lot of time to prepare for it.
