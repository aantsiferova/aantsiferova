title: Choosing type of interface in a new progect
---
### My previous experience
During my studies and scientific work, I have not faced the task of creating a user-friendly and functional graphic interface. Homework is usually set to create an effective algorithm. And, of course, we do them primarily based on the basic requirements for obtaining credit. We send our solutions and pass the exams, and the written code is unlikely to be used ever - so the most I have wrote for my programs is the command line interface (getting arguments and processing flags).

In scientific work research and searching a new solution for the problem also predominates under creating useful interface. So when I faced with need to choose the best interface for the task I am solving, I went through this area. We —Åonsidered the following types:

- Command line interfaces
	- Argparser
	- Curses
- Graphic interfaces
	- PyQT
	- Web interface

I have prepared a list of pros and cons of each type of interface regarding our task.
